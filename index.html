        <h2> Hello.</h2>
        <p class="intro">My name is Martenc and I am trying to improve my web-designing and programming skills. I am an occasional photographer and a PC games enthusiast and player. I ðŸ’— coffee and good beer as well as a glass of good wine.</p>

          <h3>Design & Development</h3>
          <p>My tactic is to get to know more of front-end to be able to dive a bit deeper into the back-end, I am just self-motivated and studying in my spare time, since I still got a regular job as a network engineer.</p>

          <h3 calss="selfmo-par">Self-motivation & Progress</h3>
          <p>I've originally started with web-design back in the day when I was 15, a lot has changed since then and I've given up a lot of times, over the time I've become a network engineer and discovered that one can achieve anything given the extra portion of time and effort. Realising that I've started from a scratch all over and again .</p>
